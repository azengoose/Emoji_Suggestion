# Emoji_Suggestion
A shit emoji suggestion program based on TextBlob, a Python library that provides a simple NLP API.
Feel free to download or clone the python file and edit/experiment with it. It ain't much, but 'tis honest work...

### A reflection on the program:
Sometimes, sentiment polarity might be kinda sus.
I have not fleshed out conditionals/dictionaries for all the different emojis. That would be insane, but cool. I assume the predictive emoji programs running on current tech have these kind of conditionals.
The problem with conditionals, is concerned with a major topic of linguistics, pragmatics.

### A brief summary of Pragmatics
Pragmatics is about the purpose of stuff we say, do and communicate. 
Like many things in linguistics, pragmatics is greatly subject to change, particularly as new technologies bring forth new mediums of expression such as emoji, which have been around for about twenty years or so. It is inevitable that more mediums of expression will develop. Such as
- Audio expressions
- AR expressions
But due to the complexity and possibility of change, not to mention the subjectivity of the emoji experience in our human lives, and our preferences for using certain emojis, I've more or less paused on updating this file.
